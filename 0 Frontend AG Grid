4) Feedback
It's not necessarily a bad design to require users to select rows and press a button before editing in AG Grid; it just depends on the use case and user experience considerations. Here’s a breakdown of when this approach might be suitable and some potential pitfalls:

When This Design is Suitable
Bulk Editing or Batch Operations: If the goal is to edit multiple rows at once, requiring selection first makes sense. It provides users with a clear indication of which rows are about to be edited.
Controlled Editing Workflow: If you want to ensure that users are intentional about their edits, this approach adds an extra step that can help prevent accidental changes.
Editing Permission or Status-Based Requirements: If only certain rows are eligible for editing based on conditions (e.g., user permissions or row status), having the button act as a trigger can be helpful in controlling the editing process.
Data Integrity Concerns: This design allows for validation or confirmation before rows become editable, reducing the risk of unintended data modification.
Potential Pitfalls
Extra Step May Be Unnecessary: For simple, quick edits, requiring users to select rows and press a button could add unnecessary friction to the process, slowing down the workflow.
Confusion or Lack of Intuitiveness: If it’s not clear why users have to select rows first or if there is no obvious visual cue indicating that rows are now editable, it could create a confusing experience.
Limited for Single-Row Editing: If users frequently need to edit individual rows, requiring selection and pressing a button might feel cumbersome compared to inline editing.
Extra Code Complexity: Implementing this approach may require additional logic for handling row selection, enabling/disabling the edit button, and managing the editing state.
Design Recommendations
To make this approach more user-friendly:

Provide Clear Feedback: When users select rows, give them a visual indication (like highlighting the selected rows) and show a message or change the button label to indicate that the rows can be edited.
Use a Toggle or Modal: Instead of making rows directly editable, consider opening a modal or side panel for editing the selected rows. This makes the process more structured and intentional.
Combine with Inline Editing: Allow for inline editing by default but provide the "select-and-edit" option for batch editing. This way, users have the flexibility to choose.
Conclusion
This design can be effective for specific use cases like batch editing or enforcing a controlled workflow, but it should be implemented with careful consideration of user experience. If done right, it can enhance data integrity and usability, but if done poorly, it may feel like an unnecessary extra step.

It’s generally not a good design to require users to select rows and press a button before they can edit in AG Grid. This approach introduces extra friction and complexity for a task that could be much more straightforward. It disrupts the flow of editing by adding unnecessary steps, which can frustrate users, especially if they frequently need to make quick edits.

Why It's Bad:
Extra Steps Are Unnecessary: For most use cases, having to select rows and press a button adds unnecessary complexity. Inline editing is faster and more intuitive.
Disrupts User Flow: Requiring row selection and a button click interrupts the natural process of making quick, simple edits.
Confusion for Users: Users may find it unclear why they need to go through extra steps just to make edits, especially if other grid-based interfaces they’re familiar with allow direct editing.
Exceptions:
The only scenarios where this approach might be acceptable are when dealing with batch operations, or strict data integrity requirements, where controlled editing is needed. Even then, there are better ways to implement those features without adding extra friction.

Conclusion:
Requiring users to select rows and press a button before editing is generally a bad design choice. Stick to more intuitive, direct editing methods for better user experience.

is it better to make one button to filter row if selected, then anotehr button to make it editable (if we include it), separation of concern

Yes, separating the filtering and editing actions with distinct buttons can be a better design choice. It follows the principle of separation of concerns and provides a clear, intuitive user experience by distinguishing between different actions.

Why It's Better:
Separation of Concerns: Having separate buttons for filtering and making rows editable keeps the functionality distinct and avoids overloading a single button with multiple responsibilities. This improves code maintainability and user experience.
Clarity of Intent: When the actions are split, users understand exactly what each button does—one for filtering rows and another for enabling editing. This avoids confusion and makes the interface more predictable.
User Control: Providing separate buttons gives users more flexibility to first narrow down the list of rows through filtering and then selectively enable editing, making the process more intentional.
Enhanced Workflow: If you need to apply different conditions for filtering or want to allow users to preview filtered rows before editing, this approach supports a structured, step-by-step workflow.
Potential Drawbacks:
Extra Buttons May Clutter the Interface: Adding more buttons could lead to a cluttered user interface if not well-designed. However, this can be mitigated with good layout and labeling practices.
More Steps May Slow Down Simple Tasks: While it provides more control, it could slow down the process if users frequently need to filter and edit in quick succession.
Conclusion:
Using separate buttons for filtering rows and making them editable is generally a good design choice, as it aligns with the principles of separation of concerns and improves clarity. It offers a more structured and user-friendly approach, especially in complex workflows where filtering and editing serve different purposes.
