If you have server-side pagination in AG Grid, but the user needs to download all related data, including data that is not currently loaded in the grid due to pagination, handling this efficiently for large datasets becomes crucial.

Key Considerations:
Performance: Downloading all data in one go, especially for large datasets, can be slow and resource-intensive for both the server and the client.
Data Format: You need to decide on the appropriate format for the download (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON), and ensure that the data is properly structured for the user's needs.
Server and Client Load: Ensure that the server can handle large queries efficiently, and avoid overloading the client with too much data at once.
Approach: Efficient Download of Large Datasets
Option 1: Request All Data from the Server (Backend Processing)
This is the most straightforward method. The user initiates a request to download the entire dataset, and the server processes the query for the full dataset based on any active filters and sorting.

Hereâ€™s how you can handle this:

1. Frontend (AG Grid)
You add a download button that triggers a request to the server for all related data, not just the paginated subset.

jsx
Copy code
const downloadAllData = () => {
  const filterModel = gridRef.current.getFilterModel();
  const sortModel = gridRef.current.getSortModel();

  const requestBody = {
    filterModel: filterModel, // Send the filter criteria
    sortModel: sortModel,     // Send the sort criteria
  };

  fetch('/api/download-all-data', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
  })
    .then(response => response.blob()) // Get the file as a Blob
    .then(blob => {
      // Create a link and trigger download
      const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([blob]));
      const link = document.createElement('a');
      link.href = url;
      link.setAttribute('download', 'data.csv'); // or .xlsx, .json based on your export format
      document.body.appendChild(link);
      link.click();
      link.parentNode.removeChild(link);
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error downloading data:', error));
};

// Button for downloading all data
<button onClick={downloadAllData}>Download All Data</button>
2. Backend (FastAPI)
You create a new endpoint (/download-all-data) that handles fetching the entire dataset, applying any filters and sorting, and preparing it for download in the desired format.

Example with CSV export in FastAPI:

python
Copy code
import csv
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response
from io import StringIO
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

app = FastAPI()

# Mock data for demonstration purposes
data = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "John", "age": 25},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Jane", "age": 30},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Mike", "age": 22},
    # More data here...
]

class SortModel(BaseModel):
    colId: str
    sort: str

class FilterModel(BaseModel):
    field: str
    type: str
    filter: str

class DownloadRequest(BaseModel):
    sortModel: Optional[List[SortModel]] = None
    filterModel: Optional[dict] = None

@app.post("/api/download-all-data")
async def download_all_data(request: DownloadRequest):
    filtered_data = data

    # Apply filtering logic
    if request.filterModel:
        for field, filter_info in request.filterModel.items():
            if filter_info['type'] == 'equals':
                filtered_data = [row for row in filtered_data if str(row[field]) == str(filter_info['filter'])]

    # Apply sorting logic
    if request.sortModel:
        for sort in request.sortModel:
            reverse = sort.sort == 'desc'
            filtered_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[sort.colId], reverse=reverse)

    # Create CSV file
    output = StringIO()
    writer = csv.DictWriter(output, fieldnames=filtered_data[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(filtered_data)

    return Response(content=output.getvalue(), media_type="text/csv", headers={
        "Content-Disposition": "attachment; filename=data.csv"
    })
Explanation:
Frontend:
getFilterModel() and getSortModel() retrieve the current filters and sorting from AG Grid.
A POST request is sent to the server to request all data that matches the filters and sorting criteria.
The server returns a file (CSV in this case), and it is downloaded by the user.
Backend:
Filters and sorting are applied to the entire dataset on the server side, not just the paginated subset.
The data is processed and returned as a CSV file. You can easily change this to return other formats such as Excel or JSON.
Option 2: Stream the Data to the Client (Chunked Download)
For extremely large datasets, generating and downloading the entire dataset at once may not be efficient. In such cases, streaming the data in chunks could be a better option to avoid memory overloads.

In this case, you stream data to the client incrementally.

python
Copy code
@app.post("/api/download-all-data")
async def download_all_data(request: DownloadRequest):
    def data_stream():
        # Apply filters and sorting logic
        filtered_data = apply_filters_and_sorting(data, request)

        # Write data in chunks
        output = StringIO()
        writer = csv.DictWriter(output, fieldnames=filtered_data[0].keys())
        writer.writeheader()
        yield output.getvalue()
        output.truncate(0)
        output.seek(0)

        for row in filtered_data:
            writer.writerow(row)
            yield output.getvalue()
            output.truncate(0)
            output.seek(0)

    return StreamingResponse(data_stream(), media_type="text/csv", headers={
        "Content-Disposition": "attachment; filename=data.csv"
    })
Benefits:
Memory Efficient: Data is processed and sent in chunks, which can handle larger datasets without using up too much memory on the server or the client.
Option 3: Asynchronous Job with Notification
If the dataset is extremely large, you may want to offload the data generation to an asynchronous background job and notify the user once the file is ready for download. You can do this using a task queue like Celery or Dramatiq in FastAPI.

Frontend: User requests the download, and you notify them when the file is ready via a status update or email.
Backend: You create a background task that handles generating the file asynchronously. Once ready, the file is stored on the server, and a link to download it is sent back to the user.
Steps:
User clicks to download: A background task is triggered.
Server prepares the file asynchronously: Meanwhile, the user can continue working.
User gets notified: Once the file is ready, the user can download it.
This approach is ideal when generating the file might take a long time.

Summary of Strategies:
Request All Data: Send a request to the server to fetch and download the full dataset, applying all filters and sorting.
Stream Data: Stream large datasets in chunks to the client to avoid memory overloads.
Background Task: Offload the file generation to a background task and notify the user when it's ready for download.
The approach depends on the size of your dataset and how frequently large downloads are needed. Let me know if you'd like more details on implementing any of these options!
