To share state and the ability to update that state (`setState`) between two different pages in React when using `router.push`, you can approach it in a few different ways:

### 1. **Using Context API**
The **Context API** allows you to share state across different components and pages without having to pass props through every level. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: Create a context

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

// Create the context
export const MyContext = createContext();

export const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState('Initial state');

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ sharedState, setSharedState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

#### Step 2: Wrap your app in the context provider

You need to wrap your entire application or at least the part that requires access to the shared state with the `MyProvider`.

```jsx
import { MyProvider } from './path_to_provider';

function App() {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      {/* Your router or page components here */}
    </MyProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Step 3: Access shared state and setState in pages

In any component or page, you can now use the shared state and `setState` via the `useContext` hook.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { MyContext } from './path_to_provider';

const PageOne = () => {
  const { sharedState, setSharedState } = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Shared State: {sharedState}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setSharedState('Updated state from Page One')}>
        Update State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PageOne;
```

You can do the same on the second page to access or update the state.

### 2. **Passing State through Router**
If you want to pass the state through `router.push` directly, you can pass the state as part of the query or route params, but this won’t let you pass the `setState` function. This is not ideal for `setState`, but here’s how you can pass the current state:

```jsx
router.push({
  pathname: '/nextPage',
  query: { stateValue: sharedState }
});
```

And then, in the next page, you can access it using `useRouter`:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const NextPage = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { stateValue } = router.query;

  return <div>Received state: {stateValue}</div>;
};
```

However, this method is more suitable for state that you don't need to modify frequently.

### 3. **Using Global State Libraries**
If your app scales and you need more complex state management, libraries like **Redux**, **Recoil**, or **Zustand** can help manage shared state more effectively.

### Final Recommendation
For most cases in React, especially if you're not using complex state management, **Context API** is the cleanest and most React-friendly way to share state between pages, especially for small to medium-sized applications.
